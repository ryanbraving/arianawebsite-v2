                        Dr Ariana graduated from the Martha Beck Institute where
                        she studied the science behind life transformation, the
                        art of thought dissolving and practical tools to
                        consolidate change. She has also studied with the
                        Institute for Integrative Nutrition where she learned
                        innovative coaching methods, practical lifestyle
                        management techniques, and over 100 dietary theories –
                        Ayurveda, gluten-free, Paleo, raw, vegan, macrobiotics,
                        and everything in between.
                        <br />
                        More than that during the past 10 years of her life she
                        has been studying mindfulness practices and spiritual
                        personal growth literature avidly. All her life has been
                        and is about realizing what life is really about and
                        seeking her own liberation. So whatever she is
                        delivering to her clients has been experimented and
                        tested at least through her own personal journey. Ariana
                        is a coach who really walks her talk and deeply believes
                        in what she does. She really is a pretty damn unique
                        combo.
                        <br />
                        Her education has equipped her with extensive,
                        cutting-edge knowledge in understanding human behaviour,
                        habit changing, holistic nutrition, health coaching, and
                        prevention. Drawing on her expertise. She can
                        confidently guarantee you that each session will leave
                        you feeling inspired and motivated. Each session would
                        leave you inspired to bring balance to the most
                        important elements of your life such as connection to
                        self, love and relationships, health and diet, career
                        and money. She will personally and carefully guide you
                        to make simple, small changes that transform your life.
                        <br />
                        It worth mentioning that during her journey so far, she
                        has had the studentship honour of some world's top
                        spirituality, personal growth, holistic health experts,
